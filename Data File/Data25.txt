The coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown restrictions in 2020 saw a record ¬£126.9 billion increase in bank deposits from households. 
These ‚Äúforced savings‚Äù led to a rise in household savings of a record 23.9% in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020. 
Since restrictions were lifted, household spending has returned to levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic. 
After the largest quarterly fall on record of 20.5% between April and June 2020, household spending was 3.6% above pre-coronavirus levels between October and December 2021. 
Over the course of 2021, household bank deposits fell by ¬£65.6 billion, likely because of increased spending opportunities and consumer confidence. 
Since the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic began, there has been a rise in the availability of loans to households and businesses, which contrasts with the experience of the 2008 - 2009 global financial crisis. 
Following the pandemic, all types of consumer credit lending saw a sharp fall, in particular, lending on credit cards. One factor might be the build-up in household savings, which may have reduced the need for consumer credit. 
In recent months, there has been a sharp rise in cost and price inflationary pressures. Adults have reported using credit more than usual, possibly in response to the rising cost of living. Credit card lending has increased by 10.6% on the year in March 2022, in contrast with a falling trend in consumer credit in 2020 and 2021. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey found that 14% of adults reported using credit more than usual in response to a higher cost of living in May 2022, a rise from 11% from early April 2022. 
Over the course of the pandemic, businesses increased their borrowing, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprise and short-term loans. These loans typically contribute a significant share towards total business loans, reflecting businesses‚Äô reliance on bank lending to manage cash flow and operations. 
In 2020, there was a large rise in deposits held by households, to the equivalent of 9% of GDP, which largely reflected the effects of ‚Äòforced‚Äô savings in response to coronavirus restrictions. Businesses also increased their deposits holdings to 7.2% of GDP, which may have been a precautionary response to more uncertain business conditions. 
In early June 2022, businesses in the UK not permanently stopped trading were asked whether they were using, or intending to use, home working as a permanent business model.
One in five (19%) of those businesses with 10 or more employees reported that they were.
In early June 2022, the percentage of businesses with 10 or more employees who reported that they were using, or intending to use, increased home working as a permanent business model remained broadly stable compared with early April 2022.
The main reason these businesses reported that they were using, or intending to use, increased homeworking was improved staff well-being, at 79%. However, this percentage has decreased from 83% reported in early April 2022.
Further details including the full list of concerns broken down by industry and size band (including those businesses with less than 10 employees) are available in our accompanying dataset.
More than one in four UK businesses (26%) reported price inflation was their main concern looking ahead to July 2022. 
In June 2022, the proportion of businesses with no concerns for the following month rose to 24%, from 21% in May 2022. 
There have also been falls in the number of online job adverts across every English region and UK country in the latest period. 
The total number of online job averts on 10 June 2022 was 129% of its February 2020 pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) average level. 
Of the 28 categories measured, 25 saw a decrease in the number of online job adverts compared with three weeks ago. 
The largest decrease was in ‚Äúmanufacturing‚Äù (22%), followed by ‚Äúfacilities and maintenance‚Äù (17%). The largest increase compared with three weeks ago was in ‚Äúwholesale and retail‚Äù at 6%.

UK labour productivity was highest in London and the South East in 2020, continuing a long-term trend. 
Productivity levels as measured by output per hour worked were highest in London with productivity more than 50% higher than the UK median level. Productivity measured by output per job was also highest in London. However, this measure is likely to have been affected by the furlough scheme that was in place in 2020, when many jobs were not being carried out for periods of the year.

  Overseas residents made 44% fewer trips to the UK in 2021 than the previous year, because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic Visits to and from the UK 2001 to 2021          Download this chart Overseas residents made 44% fewer trips to the UK in 2021 than the previous year, because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic Image  .csv   .xls   
Of those people who did visit the UK, they spent 7% less than in 2020; from ¬£6.2 billion to ¬£5.8 billion.
The restrictions of the pandemic also had an effect on the volume of visitors from the UK to visit overseas, 20% fewer than the previous year and equating to 19.1 million visits.
Those UK residents who did go abroad, spent ¬£15.5 billion in 2021; this was an 12% increase on 2020. UK residents spent ¬£15.5 billion on visits abroad in 2021, an increase of 12% compared with modelled data for 2020. The average spend per visit was ¬£809 in 2021. Values for 2020 are not known, but this was an increase from ¬£670 in 2019. 
Some of this increase is because of the longer time spent abroad, likely to be because of the restrictions on travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 
For example, overseas residents stayed an increased number of nights compared with an average of 18 days in previous years. The average spend per day fell from ¬£69 in 2019 to ¬£46 in 2021 as more visits were to visit friends and family rather than the usual holidays. 
The data also showed that visitors to the UK in 2021 were predominantly there to visit friends or family, with 3.3 million visits. It was the first time this type of visit outnumbered holidays to the UK.
Estimates for the period April to December 2020 in this release are based on administrative sources and modelling. The methods used are described in our Data sources and quality.
