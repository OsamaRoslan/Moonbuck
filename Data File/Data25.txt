Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport use among UK residents fell by just under 37% from 2019 to 2020 ‚Äì the biggest fall recorded of any sector. 
This contributed to an overall fall in GHG emissions of 13%, which is the biggest single year fall since these statistics began in 1990. It coincided with the nationwide lockdowns to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

Household saving as a proportion of household resources increased significantly during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, peaking at a record 23.9% in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020. 
The sharp rise coincided with government-imposed restrictions on social contact and economic activities resulting in significantly reduced household spending. 
It is estimated that approximately three-quarters of the increase in household savings during the coronavirus pandemic was the result of forced saving. This amounts to over ¬£140 billion, or around 10% of annual household disposable income. 
In Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2021, the household saving ratio fell to 6.8%, close to the pre-coronavirus pandemic level of 6.0% in Quarter 4 2019.

Employment levels have recovered well since the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in all G7 countries. 
However, employment remains marginally below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels in all of these countries except for Canada and France where employment levels are now higher than Quarter 4 2019. 
In North America, employment fell sharply in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic reflecting short-term layoffs. In Europe, the falls in employment were far more contained demonstrating the relative success of enhanced job retention schemes. 
Real household disposable incomes fell during 2020 in Europe but increased in North America and Japan, reflecting the impact of direct cash handouts to households.

The lowest-priced supermarket everyday items have increased in price by around as much as average food and non-alcoholic drink prices in the 12 months to April 2022.
Highly experimental research examined 30 everyday food and non-alcoholic grocery items, scraped from the websites of the seven major supermarkets, and found a wide variation in their prices, with some rising by 15% or more.
For 13 of the 30 sampled items, the average lowest price increased at a faster rate than the latest consumer price inflation for food and non-alcoholic drinks (6.7%) in the year to April 2022. For six of the 30, the lowest prices fell on average in the same period.

The items where the lowest prices rose at the fastest rate were pasta (up 50% between April 2021 and April 2022), crisps (17%), bread (16%), minced beef (16%) and rice (15%).
For 6 of the 30 items, the lowest prices fell on average over the 12 months to April 2022. Price decreases were measured for potatoes (a 14% fall in price), cheese (7%), pizza (4%), chips (3%), sausages (3%) and apples (1%).
The research also found a considerable difference between the lowest-cost version of an item and the next lowest-cost version, with most items at least 20% more expensive.
