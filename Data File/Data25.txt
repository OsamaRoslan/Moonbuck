The number of job vacancies in the UK reached new record levels of 1.3 million in the three months to May 2022.
However, the rate of growth in the number of job vacancies has continued to slow in the latest period.
In February to April 2022, the employment rate rose by 0.2 percentage points to 75.6%. This remains below the levels seen before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The number of full-time employees rose to a record high, but was offset by a fall in the number of part-time employees.
The unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percentage points to 3.8% in the same period, and the economic inactivity rate fell by 0.1 percentage points to 21.3%.
Adjusted for inflation, in February to April 2022, regular pay (excluding bonuses) fell by 2.2% on the year. Strong bonus payments kept real terms total pay growth positive at 0.4%.
Gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.3% in April 2022, after a decline of 0.1% in March 2022. 
Services fell by 0.3% in April 2022 and was the largest contributor to that month‚Äôs fall in GDP. Human health and social work activities fell by 5.6% in April and was the main negative contributor to that month‚Äôs fall in services. The driver of this fall was human health activities, which fell by 7.6%. This largely reflects the significant reduction in NHS Test and Trace activity following the changes to testing policy in England from April. 
Production output fell for the third consecutive month in April 2022, with a contraction of 0.6%, primarily driven by manufacturing. Manufacturing decreased by 1.0% in April with falls in 8 out of 13 of the sub-sectors. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the manufacturing sub-sector was affected by increasing prices, in particular petrol and energy prices. 
Construction output decreased by 0.4% in April 2022. This is the first monthly decrease since October 2021 (fall of 0.9%) following five consecutive months of growth. Despite the monthly fall, construction output was still 3.3% above its pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic level (February 2020) in April 2022.

Total exports of goods, excluding precious metals, increased by ¬£2.2 billion (7.4%) in April 2022 compared with March 2022. This was driven by a ¬£1.2 billion (8.1%) increase in exports to EU countries, while exports to non-EU countries increased by ¬£0.9 billion (6.5%). EU exports have increased for the third consecutive month and reached ¬£16.4 billion in April 2022, their highest level in current prices since the series began in 1997. 
The Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February and in response, the UK government has imposed a range of economic sanctions on Russia from late February and early March. Exports to Russia in April 2022 fell to the lowest monthly value since January 1999. Imports from Russia fell to the lowest monthly value since March 2004, with imports of fuels reducing by ¬£0.3 billion in April. 
Total imports of goods, excluding precious metals, increased by ¬£0.4 billion (0.7%) in April 2022 compared with March 2022. Imports from EU countries increased by ¬£1.1 billion (4.2%), while imports from non-EU countries fell by ¬£0.7 billion (2.6%). 
Imports from EU countries were ¬£0.6 billion higher than from non-EU countries in April 2022. Non-EU imports were higher than EU imports for most of 2021, linked to the large increases in the imports of fuels in the last months of the year. Imports of fuels from non-EU countries increased by ¬£0.6 billion in April 2022. 
In January 2022,‚ÄØHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) implemented a data collection change‚ÄØaffecting data on imports from the EU to Great Britain. As a result,‚ÄØour EU to Great Britain import statistics‚ÄØfrom January 2022 are not directly comparable with previous months. HMRC is continuing to assess any impacts of this change and drivers to the current import trends.
