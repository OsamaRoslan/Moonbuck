Household saving as a proportion of household resources increased significantly during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, peaking at a record 23.9% in Quarter 2 2020. 
The sharp rise coincided with government-imposed restrictions on social contact and economic activities resulting in significantly reduced household spending. 
It is estimated that approximately three-quarters of the increase in household savings during the pandemic was the result of forced saving. This amounts to over ¬£140 billion, or around 10% of annual household disposable income. 
In Quarter 4 2021, the household saving ratio fell to 6.8%, close to the pre-pandemic level of 6.0% in Quarter 4 2019.

Employment levels have recovered well since the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in all G7 countries. 
However, employment remains marginally below pre-pandemic levels in all of these countries except for Canada and France where employment levels are now higher than Quarter 4 2019. 
In North America, employment fell sharply in the early stages of the pandemic reflecting short-term layoffs. In Europe the falls in employment were far more contained demonstrating the relative success of enhanced job retention schemes. 
Real household disposable incomes fell during 2020 in Europe but increased in North America and Japan, reflecting the impact of direct cash handouts to households.

The lowest-priced supermarket everyday items have increased in price by around as much as average food and non-alcoholic drink prices in the 12 months to April 2022.
Highly experimental research examined 30 everyday food and non-alcoholic grocery items, scraped from the websites of the seven major supermarkets, and found a wide variation in their prices, with some rising by 15% or more.
For 13 of the 30 sampled items, the average lowest price increased at a faster rate than the latest consumer price inflation for food and non-alcoholic drinks (6.7%) in the year to April 2022. For six of the 30, the lowest prices fell on average in the same period.

Over 4 in 10 (44%) adults reported that they were buying less food when shopping in the past two weeks. This proportion appears to be increasing from 41% in the previous period (27 April to 8 May 2022) and 18% at the beginning of 2022.
Around 9 out of 10 (88%) adults in Great Britain said their living costs had risen over the last month, the same as the previous period. When we first started asking this question in the period 3 to 14 November 2021, the proportion was 62%.
The most common reasons given by adults who reported their costs had increased in the latest period continued to be an increase in the price of food (93%), gas or electricity bills (85%), and an increase in the cost of fuel (78%).
